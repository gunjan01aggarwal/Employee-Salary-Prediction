Data Preprocessing:->
                    As we saw it, our dataset doesn't have any null values. This dataset contains 10,00000 rows and 9 columns.But i trained the model on 300000 rows and 9 columns.It contains mutiple categorical feature as compared to numerical feature. Machine learning algorithm understands numeric input. So first i have to convert those features into numerical. I used some encoding techniques like Label Encoder. Label Encoder applied on ordinal features like degree and jobtype. Both have its order. Other Encoding Techniques is One Hot Encoding which applied on nominal features like industry,major domain and etc. 
                    
Exploratory Data Analysis:->
Analyse each feature by using seaborn and matplotlib library.How correlate the features with each other??
